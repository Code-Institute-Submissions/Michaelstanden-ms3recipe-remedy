Recipe Remedy a recipe website where users can sign up and login to create and upload their own recipes, as well as delete or edit their existing recipes.
Website is built by using the CRUD philosophy
This is a work in progress for a fullstack database website using flask, jinja templating, Heroku deployment and materialize frameworks. 
I have also used html, css, javascript JQuery and Python for other languages.

A live link to the heroku deployment is <a href="https://ms3recipe-mongo.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Here</a>

I have implemented a session cookies login that recognises the user.
